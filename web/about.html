					<h1>What is Gerrymandering Online?</h1>

					<p>
						Gerrymandering Online is a website designed to show information and statistics about a state's congressional districts and voting precincts. We allow you to redistrict a state using the currently existing boundaries and other constraints like efficiency gap, compactness and population threshold. You can view properties of the state, district and precinct, like the voting records for the most recent election year.

					<h1>What is Gerrymandering?</h1>

					<p>
						According to wikipedia, gerrymandering is a practice that involves manipulating district boundaries in order for a political party to gain an advantage in representation. In this app, we will be looking at the most recent elections for congressional districts.
					</p>

					<h1>How does Gerrymandering work?</h1>

					<p>
						The goal of gerrymandering is to waste the most amount of votes by grouping certain neighboring voting precincts together. This is done by measuring the efficiency gap, which is the difference in wasted votes for a district. Another measure used to determine if gerrymandering exists is compactness, which measures the closeness of the district to a circle.
					</p>

					<h1>What constitutes a district that is "gerrymandered"?</h1>

					<p>
						A gerrymandered district can have visual features to it, like being abnormally shaped or not completely connected with respect to other districts. This, combined with a lower compactness score, could be an indication of a gerrymandered district. The main goal of a gerrymandered district is to minimize the votes for an opposing political party, so a district with a near or close to zero efficiency gap is one that can be considered gerrymandered.
